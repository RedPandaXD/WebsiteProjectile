    <h1> Types of Rubber Band Projectiles </h1>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p> There are many types of rubber band projectiles. Each type has its on strength, but being able to obtain the strength would also mean it has a weakness. </p>
    <p> Here are the most distinct types: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <h3 class="hehehe"> Bolt-Action </h3> <p> This type usually does not hold too many rubber bands (possibly 4-8), and the rubber bands should be made from many other rubber bands, making it shoot faster and possibly more consistent. This type is extremely accurate within 15 feet, hitting the target almost every single time, but is the duration between each shot may be longer than other projectiles. If better performance is desired, these can be very lengthy. </p> </li>
      <li> <h3 class="hehehe"> Semiautomatic: </h3> <p> This type usually could hold slightly more rubber bands (possibly 8-15). These are accurate to an extent, probably hitting the target 7 out 10 times withing 10 feet, and have faster reload. Usually these only require the pull of the trigger, instead of having the user to manually reload after every shot.</p> </li>
      <li> <h3 class="hehehe"> Automatic: </h3> <p> This type usually holds at least 15 rubber bands, and can hold as much as 40. They could possibly hold more, but then the performance would be slightly worse. These usually have very fast reload spitting out 20 rubber bands in 5 seconds. The drawback, however, is that these usually have poor range and aim. These could be used to just spray the target, which guarantees a hit either way. More accurate ones could be made, but these could never beat the semiautomatic or bolt actions rubber band projectiles in accuracy. On the bright side, these are very powerful at close range. </p> </li>
    </ul>
