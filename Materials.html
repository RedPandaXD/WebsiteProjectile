    <h2> Materials For Rubber Band Projectiles</h2>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p> There are many materials for rubber band projectiles.. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <h3> Rubber Bands </h3>
       <p>Smaller rubber bands such as rainbowloom work better for rubber band projectiles with faster reload, and larger rubber bands work better for more powerful shots. Or, the user may choose to loop many of the same rubber band together, increasing the range, power, and accuracy.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li> <h3> Functionality </h3>
        <p>Materials for the moving parts of the projectile have to be easily movable, sturdy, and able to take apart and improve without much difficulty. The best material for this would be Lego Technic, as it is made with very durable plastics, its size is faily small, meaning that it would not take too much space, and the joints are slightly looser, so the projectile can run freely.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li> <h3> Base Material </h3>
        <p>The Base Material for the projectile decides what it looks like and what it can withstand, along with what type of style it would be. For example, more accurate projectiles may need slightly more rigid, long pieces such as long wooden dowels. Builds more complicated such as a fully automatic projectile that can shoot up to 40 rounds might need more flexibility, resulting in the entire projectile based around Lego. The more stucture a projectile has, usually the more sturdy and long lasting it can be. Legos can be made very rigid, but to accomodate the functionality, often times the base may be compromised.
